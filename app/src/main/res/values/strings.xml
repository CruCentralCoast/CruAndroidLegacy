        whatsoever.\n\n\n\n

        9.	Ownership.\n\n
        Cru’s technology and all intellectual property embodied in, or associated with the
        technology are owned by and are the property of Cru, and subject to applicable patent,
        copyright, trade secrets, trademarks and other proprietary rights.  The technology is
        licensed, not sold, to you for use only under the terms of this Agreement.  Cru reserves
        all rights not expressly granted to the User.  The technology and any authorized copies you
        make thereof are the intellectual property of Cru.  The structure, organization, and code of
        the technology are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Cru. The
        technology is protected by law, including without limitation the copyright laws of the
        United States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as
        expressly stated herein, this Agreement does not grant you any intellectual property rights
        in the technology. The technology may be covered by one or more pending patent applications.\n\n\n\n

        10.	Third-Party Claims.\n\n
        In the event any claim is brought against you alleging that the technology or your
        possession and use of the technology breaches any third-party’s intellectual property
        rights, your sole remedy is to immediately notify Cru in writing. Cru shall not be liable
        for any defense, settlement, or discharge of such claim, except as provided in the preceding
        sentence. You agrees that, in the event Cru notifies you to immediately cease using the
        technology due to a third-party claim of infringement, regulatory or legal requirement or
        for any other reasonable purpose, you shall do so promptly.\n\n\n\n

        11.	Injunctive Relief.\n\n
        You agree that in the event of a breach of any provision of this Agreement, Cru shall be
        entitled to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, or both, in each case
        without the requirement to post any bond or other form of security, and without such act
        constituting an election of remedies or disentitling Cru to each and every remedy available
        at law or in equity for a breach of this Agreement by you.\n\n\n\n

        12.	Limitation of Liability\n\n
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CRU WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
        SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER
        INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE

        MOBILE APP; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY IN THIS MOBILE APP, INCLUDING

        13.	Arbitration\n\n
        Unless you are an employee of Cru and subject to Cru’s internal dispute resolution policy,
        for any dispute you have with Cru regarding this Mobile App, you agree to first contact us
        and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.  If Cru has not been able to resolve
        the dispute with you informally, we agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy
        (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection
        with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration
        Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for
        Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein.  Unless you
        and Cru agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the state or federal courts in
        Orange County, Florida, United States of America.  Each party will be responsible for paying
        any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.  The award
        rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and
        reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by
        the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Nothing in this Section
         will prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts
         for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the
         Mobile App.  ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A
         PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS
         WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS.  YOU
         AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CRU ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL
         BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.\n\n\n\n

        14.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction\n\n
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, without respect to its
        conflict of laws principles.  We each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of
        a state or federal court in Orange County, Florida for any actions not subject to
        Section 10 (Arbitration).\n\n

        This Mobile App is controlled and operated from the United States of America, and we make
        no representations that it is appropriate or available for use in other locations.\n\n\n\n

        15.	General Terms\n\n
        Notification Procedures and changes to these Terms.  Cru reserves the right to determine
        the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices
        electronically if we so choose.  We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most
        current version will always be posted.  If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material
        we will notify you.  By continuing to access or use this Mobile App after revisions become
        effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.  If you do not agree to the new
        terms, please stop using this Mobile App.\n\n

        Assignment.  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
        transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Cru without restriction.  Any
        attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof will be null and void.\n\n

        Entire Agreement/Severability.  These Terms, together with the Privacy Notice and any
        amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Cru in connection with
        this Mobile App, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Cru concerning this Mobile
        App.  If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited
        or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms
        will remain in full force and effect.\n\n

        No Waiver.  No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing
        waiver of such term or any other term, and Cru’s failure to assert any right or provision
        under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n\n\n\n
